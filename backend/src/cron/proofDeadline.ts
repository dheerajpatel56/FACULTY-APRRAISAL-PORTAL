/**
 * Void the marks for proofs that were rejected and never corrected.
 *
 * A submission on HOLD blocks the whole workflow: the HoD cannot approve while
 * any proof is unverified, so one ignored rejection would stall the appraisal
 * indefinitely. Once the correction deadline passes, the source behind each
 * still-rejected proof is voided — its rows score nothing — and the submission
 * returns to SUBMITTED so the review can proceed on the reduced marks.
 *
 * The faculty STAYS red-listed. The point is to unblock the workflow, not to
 * forgive the missing evidence: `redListed` remains true and the hold reason is
 * kept as the record of why the marks were cut.
